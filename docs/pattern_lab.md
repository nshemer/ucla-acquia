# Syncing with Pattern Lab

The SiteDen Surface theme uses files from the SiteDen Pattern Lab
[https://bitbucket.org/siteden/siteden-patternlab](https://bitbucket.org/siteden/siteden-patternlab)

## Pull in code from Pattern Lab

Syncing code is as easy as running the Docksal command below.

```
$ fin theme-sync
```
This will pull in the master branch from the SiteDen Pattern Lab and then move
CSS, JS, and images into the theme and compile them.

The pulled in code can now be committed to the theme with git.
